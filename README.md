# SlipStream

## Overview
SlipStream is a Race Engine which is designed for handling race telemetry data. It efficiently manages the collection, storage, and streaming of real-time information from racing vehicles.

## Core Functionality
- **Data Collection**: Captures high-frequency telemetry data from vehicles during races
- **Structured Storage - SQLite**: Organizes and preserves telemetry information in optimized formats using SQLite for fast performance
- **Real-time Streaming - Apache Kafka**: Delivers data to clients for immediate monitoring and analysis using Kafka for stream processing

## Key Considerations
- Optimized for high-performance data processing
- Designed to handle continuous streams of telemetry information
- Supports visualization and analytical tools for race performance insights

## Primary Use Cases
1. Live race monitoring and team strategy development
2. Post-race analysis and performance evaluation
3. Driver training and vehicle optimization
